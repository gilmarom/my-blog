 q: So lets start with the explanation on how does AD develop?
</p>
<p> 
 a:  We have known for a century that patients with AD have amyloid plaques and tau tangles, but the unwarranted assumption has been that these are the cause (rather than the effect) of AD. Additional changes, such as inflammation, glial cell activation, mitochondrial changes, and dozens of specific changes in gene expression, have also been seen as “the” cause of AD. The reality is more complex. Indeed, there has been no trial that has ever shown that altering amyloid, tau, or other biomarkers have any effect on the course of the disease. We might better view AD as a cascade of complex pathology that results in clinical changes.  More importantly, understanding the fundamental elements of this cascade suggests that the single, most effective point of clinical intervention is well “upstream” and that the “downstream” events (such as amyloid plaques) are merely symptoms, hence ineffective as points of clinical intervention. In a simplified, broad outline, the AD pathology cascade is this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
 The glial cells (including microglia, astroglia, etc.) that support neuronal function in the brain, divide over time in response to physiological needs and to replace lost glial cells. The rate of division is more frequent in the context of infection, trauma, etc., which is why these are risk       factors for earlier onset AD.
</li>
<li>
 When glial cells divide, their telomeres shorten in accordance with known chromosomal function during cell division.
</li>
<li>
 When telomeres shorten, the relative change in lengths modulates a subtle but progressive change in gene expression throughout the cell. This is an epigenetic, not a genetic change, resulting in a change in gene expression, not a change in genes.
</li>
<li>
 The changes in gene expression include, among other things, a decrease in the rate of molecular turnover, or what might be seen as the molecular recycling rate. This includes not only protein pools, but lipid molecules (e.g., membrane molecules), DNA repair enzymes, inter and intracellular molecules (i.e., extracellular proteins). In the case of the CNS, this includes a well-established deceleration of the “recycling rate” of beta amyloid and other key molecules. In the case of beta amyloid, we see a significant slowdown in the ability of glial cells to:
  Produce new, undamaged amyloid molecules,
  Bind intracellular amyloid, e.g., perineuronal amyloid,
  Reuptake of amyloid (import amyloid back into glial cells), and
  Break down (degrade) amyloid once it is inside the glial cell.
</li>
<li>
   As (and other molecular) turnover slows, the percent of damaged amyloid in the intracellular pool increases.
</li>
<li>
   As the percent of damage increases, molecules cross-link and aggregate, forming amyloid microplaques and then gross amyloid plaques.
</li>
<li>
 As the plaques grow (and as the available, functional amyloid decreases), neurons undergo toxic changes and begin to dysfunction.
</li>
<li>
 When the plaques are sufficiently large and increasingly widely distributed (and functional amyloid sufficiently rare), the dysfunctional undergo necrosis and frank neuronal death is observed at the microscopic level.
</li>
<li>
 Neuronal dysfunction and neuronal loss both result in a growing loss of neuronal networks, and a growing dysfunction of subsystems throughout the affected cortical areas.
</li>
<li>
10. As brain function becomes impaired, memory and cognition fail, and we see the clinical result as progressive Alzheimer’s disease.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
 q: Why have prior interventions failed to cure AD?
</p>
<p> 
 a: Prior interventions have not only failed to cure AD but have failed to slow or alter disease progression. No previous trial has ever demonstrated any effect upon disease progression. The problem is that, thus far, we have consistently aimed at the wrong targets because we have not appreciated, nor have we understood, the complexity of AD pathology. To date, interventional trials have uniformly aimed at the symptoms (or biomarkers) rather than the causes of AD and, equally, all such interventional trials (more than 400 registered human trials) have failed alter disease progression in AD. To use an analogy, consider the clinical presentation of Ebola virus infection that includes bleeding diathesis, fever, hypotension, etc. When we attempt to treat AD by focusing on amyloid, for example, it is like focusing on fever in an Ebola infection. You may successfully (if temporarily) treat the fever, but not only are there dozens of other clinical abnormalities in an Ebola infection, but we have not addressed the underlying pathology, in this case a viral infection. To think that we can cure AD by treating amyloid is like thinking we can cure Ebola by treating fever. In both cases, the attempt is laudable but naïve. 
</p>
<p>
 q: Can you tell us about your approach to cure AD?
</p>
<p> 
 a: We intervene not only at the most fundamental level of the cascade of pathology in the CNS, but at the single most effective point of clinical (and financial) intervention. This allows us to reset gene expression, reset molecular turnover, and reverse the downstream markers, such as amyloid    deposition, tau tangles, mitochondrial dysfunction, glial cell activation, etc. We do this by using a standard hTERT gene delivered in an AAV vector.
</p>
<p>
 q: Other approaches showed before great potency in rodents and failed in translation in clinical trails. Why this approach is different?
</p>
<p>
 a:  In some ways, the key problem is that we don’t appreciate that behavioral decline, whether in humans, rodents, or other animals, shares a fundamental, underlying pathology in having parallel changes at the cellular and genetic levels. As a result, many researchers assume that the only way to use animal models is to genetically alter their animal model to include a human disease biomarker. For example, mice and humans have similar behavioral declines with age, but this decline is expressed in different ways anatomically, histologically, and in terms of typical molecular biomarkers, such as the presence of amyloid plaques. Ignoring the underlying similarities in the mechanisms of cell senescence that are expressed differently in mice (for example) than in humans, most researchers will use genetically altered mice) in which they will insert a human gene (e.g., for amyloid metabolism), then intervene in that metabolism, with good results in the mice, but a failure in human trials. The problem is twofold: 1) the model (using genetically altered mice) is not relevant in that the molecular context is different in humans versus mice and 2) the molecule they are investigating (e.g., amyloid) is only one of dozens of “downstream” effects and not the cause of the entire pathology.
 To use an analogy, consider Ebola infection, which (while the underlying cause is a viral infection) is typically expressed clinically (in humans) by fever, hypotension, blood dyscrasias, etc. Other animals get Ebola, but the clinical expression is different. Consider what would happen if we altered a mouse genetically to use a human platelet gene, then showed that the altered mice (that now show bleeding, which was otherwise atypical in mice) now have bleeding and that this bleeding can be controlled with their experimental drug. They then claim that they have the “cure” for Ebola. As above, this is faulty thinking for two reasons: 1) the altered human gene is no longer expressed in the normal hematological context when expressed in mice, so there is no reason to think their result would still apply to human trials and 2) bleeding is typical of human Ebola, but is by no means the only (or the most common and most serious) clinical finding. To cure bleeding is not the same as curing Ebola. Putting it simply, curing a symptom is not the same as curing a disease. Amyloid deposition is no more the “cause” of Alzheimer’s disease than fever is the “cause” of an Ebola infection. Studies that claim that since “we reversed amyloid, therefore we cured Alzheimer’s in mice” is precisely like saying “we reversed the fever in Ebola infection, therefore we can cure Ebola”. In short, most animal studies are based on naïve misconceptions.

 q: We know that regulation of brain homeostasis is not a monopoly of microglia cells. Other glial cells such as astrocytes as well as vasculature related cells such as pericytes and endothel have significant role in maintaining the brain environment. Why focusing on microglia? Is that enough?
</p>
<p>
 a: In general, human brains have about three times as many astroglia as microglia and these two glial types (ignoring oligodendrocytes and others) almost certainly vary in their roles in supporting (in the physiological sense) neuronal function. We do know that microglial telomeres not only shorten with age in humans, but (more importantly in this context) that microglial telomeres are shorter in patients with AD than in age-matched patients without AD. We do not have equivalent data on astroglia, which makes it harder to infer the relative important of cell senescence of microglia versus astroglia in the pathology of AD. We do know that we are better able to increase telomeres in vivo in astroglia than in microglia and that, when we do so, age-related behavioral decline can be reversed. On the other hand, there remains uncertainty with regard to how well we transfect the microglia. The bottom line is that the evidence for the importance of microglia is better than for astroglia, but the theoretical basis suggests that astroglia may be more important. With regard to pericytes (and vascular endothelial cells generally), there is excellent evidence for the importance of cell senescence in age-related disease outside of the CNS, but it’s very hard to tease out the relative importance of pericytes versus (for example) glial cells in the fundamental pathology of AD. From a clinical perspective, human dementia is often divided into AD (and others) versus vascular dementia. However, we have increasingly come to recognize enormous overlap in these diagnoses, and likely (pari passu) an overlap in the underlying cellular etiology (i.e., cell senescence). While it’s quite likely that pericyte cell senescence is more prominent in “vascular dementia” and glial cell senescence is more prominent in the other dementias, such as AD, the overwhelming likelihood is that both cell types demonstrate degrees of cell senescence and that the relative state of senescence between these cell types is correlated with the relative likelihood for these two diagnostic categories.
</p>
<p>
 q: Will be able to detect at-risk patients (not patients of the genetic variant) and offer them a preventive treatment, or waiting for an overt disease and try to cure it?
</p>
<p>
 a: Our intent is to develop an effective cure for AD, which will reverse the decline and should largely (albeit not totally) return normal baseline cognitive function. In addition, the therapy should be effective prophylactically. It will be a “one time” treatment in the acute sense, although    patients will need retreatment every several years to avoid age-related cognitive diseases. It should function regardless of genetic risk (e.g., APOE4 status, etc.). It will be therapeutic and prophylactic, not diagnostic. Specifically, while it cannot be used to detect at-risk patients, it can be used to treat them.
 </p>
 <p>
 q: Previous trails of gene therapy showed incline to cancer morbidity in many of the patients. What will prevent this in your approach?
 </p>
 <p>
 a: There are two types of cancer risk in this approach: the first: those related to the vector and the second are those related to the gene used. Most vector-related risks are due to inserting a gene within the chromosomes, which risks disruption of extant genes, thereby altering cell growth controls and increasing cancer risk. AAV vectors do not insert into extant chromosomes and are not known to have this risk. The second risk is hypothetical and ascribed to TERT’s role in cancer. While this concern was voiced two decades ago, it is surprising that it is still an issue, considering both theoretical shifts and the available data. Both theory and data support the position that TERT (and telomere extension) actually lowers cancer risk, although the mechanics of this interaction are actually complex and non-linear. Although we expect the issue to be raised in FDA discussions, the data support our use of TERT genes as having a low risk of cancer and offering some potential for both prevention and even of treatment of cancer in select cases.
</p>
<p>
 q: Dysregulation of the brain environment is the key of development of multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders. Are consider to implement the telomeres approach in other disorders?
</p>
<p>
 a: Telomeres modulate gene expression, and hence the cellular (and neuronal) environment in the brain, as well as in other (non-CNS) cells and tissues. Telomerase therapy should not only be effective for AD, but other age-related CNS diseases including PD, FTD, vascular dementia, and other uncategorized (or multiply categorized) dementias. Whether this approach will have efficacy in psychiatric disorders is less likely, but unknown. Telomerase therapy is being considered for human trials in all age-related CNS disorders, as well as other, non-CNS, age-related human disease.
</p>
<p>
 q: You are one of the leading researchers in the field, where do you see the difficulties of entrepreneurs raising money for projects like yours? 
</p>
<p>
 a: Investing in innovative approaches is a delicate balance between risk and opportunity. Our approach is radically innovative, implying both greater risk and greater financial opportunity, as well as what we regard as the greatest single clinical opportunity to effectively intervene and improve patient lives. Many investors don’t understand our approach, and of those that do understand it, many are unwilling to expose themselves to this degree of financial risk, despite the enormous potential. As is usual in human affairs generally and investment specifically, everyone favors innovation unless you are truly innovative.
</p>

<p>
q: do you have milestones in product development, let's say first launching A product that tracks or facilitates the development of the disease, or it's going to be one shot to a full cure?
</p>
<p>
a: We have a well-defined program plan, encompassing our FDA-required animal toxicity study, as well as our FDA human trials, especially the phase 1 (first in human) trial. As we progress into subsequent AD trials, we will also extend our trials to other dementias and to non-CNS age-related disease, including diseases of vascular aging.
</p>
<p>
q: what clinical or other experiments results, are giving you faith, it is possible to cure AD.
</p>
<p>
a: Currently, we have good experimental data showing the reversal of aging in human cells and human tissues in vitro, as well as data from AD patients with regard to telomeres. In animals, we have excellent data showing that our approach is effective in reversing behavioral decline reliably and significantly.
</p>
<p>
q: is there a business model for your investors or it's only based on philanthropic will?
</p>
<p>
a: While we are in favor of philanthropy (and are philanthropists), our current work is a business venture with a large potential financial return.
</p>
<p>
q: What more resources are you looking for? Are you searching for labs to cooperate, what skill set interest you in for future, potential candidates?
</p>
<p>
a: Our current is to complete our initial funding to enable us to move through our phase 1 FDA human trial.
